# Upbeat

A barebones Next.js web application that does nothing other than serve an upbeat for basic health checking. This application is meant to be used as a basic container-based application for traffic flow checks.

## Getting Started

1. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

2. Visit `/up` to see your upbeat health check.
